 Running The BrightstarDB Samples
*********************************

All samples can be found in [INSTALLDIR]\\Samples. Some samples are written to run against 
a local BrightstarDB service. These samples only need editing if you want to run them 
against BrightstarDB running on a different machine or running on a non-default port. 
This is achieved by altering the BrightstarDB.ConnectionString property in the web.config 
file of the sample.
