If you need support while working with BrightstarDB there are two primary channels for asking for help. 
All BrightstarDB users are invited to join our `Codeplex Discussion Forum`_. In this forum you can ask questions and see 
the latest postings from the BrightstarDB team. 

You can also optionally purchase a support contract from NetworkedPlanet Limited. Support contracts last for a 
full year and provide you with email support from the BrightstarDB team, as well as priority bug-fixes 
and product enhancements. For more information please `email NetworkedPlanet Limited`_.
