If you need support while working with BrightstarDB there are two primary channels for asking for help. All BrightstarDB users are invited to join our Google Group. On this group you can ask questions and see the latest postings from the BrightstarDB team. For more information and a link to the group see `http://brightstardb.com/ecosystem/`_. You can also optionally purchase a support contract. Support contracts last for a full year and provide you with email support from the BrightstarDB team, as well as priority bug-fixes and product enhancements.
