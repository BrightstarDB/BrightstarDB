BrightstarDB Windows Phone Samples
----------------------------------

IMPORTANT INFORMATION!

The samples provided here all require a valid license key to run correctly.
To get your license key please visit http://brightstardb.com/customers.

If you have not purchased a license, you can still get a trial license by
registering on the customer site and then claiming your free trial license.

Once you have your license key you must edit the App.xaml.cs file in 
each of the sample projects to add the licensee ID (this is the email 
address you register on the customer site) and the license key string.

You can then compile and run the samples.
