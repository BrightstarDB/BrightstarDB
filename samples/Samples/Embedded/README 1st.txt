BrightstarDB Embedded Samples
-----------------------------

IMPORTANT INFORMATION!

By default the samples are set up to write to a folder named "BrightstarSamplesData" under your "My Documents" directory.
You can change this default by editing the file SamplesConfiguration.cs (found in the same directory as this README file).
