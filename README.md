BrightstarDB is a native .NET RDF triple store. It uses dotNetRDF to provide support for 
a wide range of RDF syntaxes as well as SPARQL query support. In addition to providing
a raw RDF-based API, BrightstarDB also provides support for binding RDF resources to
.NET dynamic objects; and a contract-first entity framework that enables the use of
LINQ rather than SPARQL for query purposes.
