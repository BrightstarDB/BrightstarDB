Items to coalesce:
	trees:
		subject_predicates index
		object_predicates index
		each related resource index
		resource index
		
	prefix index
	graph index
	resource table
	
Coalescing tree:
	Scan through source tree
	Write values to new leaf nodes, fill leaf nodes completely
	If > 1 leaf node, write intermediate nodes for leaf level
	If > 1 intermediate node, write intermediate nodes for level above and repeat until just one intermediate node
	
	while writing values to dest tree, could optionally invoke a value processing method for each value.
		- use when coalescing resource index to write coalesced resource table

Coalescing graph index
	- need to keep ids and prefixes stable, so will just have to write them.
